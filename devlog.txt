   looking for new data because our original data has major issues... oh well
   update: found the new data, and rewrote the functions for the new csv file!
   
kateJ -- 2017-04-02 17:00-18:00
   wrote functions for parsing/extrapolating data by year/state/age
   updated project descriptions with new goals
   why isn't anyone updating this devlog

   researched maps, ended up settling for just doing a square map because it seemed much easier

kateJ -- 2017-04-04 14:30-15:35
   data is now accessible from app.py

EliasM -- 2017-04-04 7:00-10:00
   created the map, does not actually reflect the data yet
